### Hello github ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on:
- [Hegarty Calculator](https://github.com/HegartyCalculator). A chrome extension which can help with HegartyMaths tasks.
- SimpleAdmin ([Organization](https://github.com/SimpleAdminRbx) and [repo](https://github.com/crywink/SimpleAdmin)). A Roblox game-management suite as a total solution to controlling your game. I work on the web backend (pro plan).

I mainly develop in JavaScript however I know a few other languages.
