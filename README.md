### Hello github ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on:
- SimpleAdmin ([Organization](https://github.com/SimpleAdminRbx) and [repo](https://github.com/crywink/SimpleAdmin)). A Roblox game-management suite as a total solution to controlling your game. I work on the web backend (pro plan).
- USystem. A private roblox framework to make the development process faster, including default libraries such as weapons, permissions and a loadout system.

I mainly develop in JavaScript and Lua however I know a few other languages.
